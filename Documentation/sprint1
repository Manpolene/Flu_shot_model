# Project Documentation: Flu Shot Learning: Predicting Vaccination Patterns
## Objective
In this sprint, we will investigate geographical and behavioral patterns in H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination uptake, explore important predictive features, and build a classification model for vaccine acceptance.

## Datasets:
- train_features.csv: Demographic and behavioral features of survey respondents
- train_labels.csv: Binary labels for H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine uptake
- test_features.csv: Feature set without labels for final prediction

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Import Libraries & Load Data
   - Loaded training and test datasets using pandas
   - Previewed the first 5 rows of each dataset for structure comprehension

2. Dataset Shapes and Columns
- Printed shape and column information to understand data dimensions and feature types
3. Merge for EDA
- Merged train_features with train_labels using respondent_id
- Used this combined dataset (train_df) for exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Missing Values
- Checked for missing values in descending order
- Calculated total and percentage of missing values
- Assessed which features require imputation or removal

5. Data Structure Examination
- Viewed data types and unique values for each feature
- Generated descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables

6. Target Distribution
- Visualized class imbalance for h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine uptake

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
7. Drop Irrelevant or Redundant Columns
- Removed non-informative or duplicate features (e.g., respondent_id, others)

8. Handle Missing Values
- Applied custom imputation strategies (mode or fill with unknown)
- region mapping

10. Encoding
- Used LabelEncoder to transform categorical features into numeric form
- Stored label encoders for use with the test set

11. New Feature Creation
- Created household_size = household_adults + household_children
- Dropped original individual features to reduce redundancy

## Correlation & Feature Analysis
12. Correlation Matrix
- Generated full correlation matrix on encoded features
- Plotted a heatmap with hierarchical clustering for visual insights

13. Redundant Feature Detection
- Identified highly correlated pairs (correlation > 0.9)
- Recommended combining or dropping redundant features

## Modeling: Random Forest Classifier
14. Feature Selection & Classification
- Trained a RandomForestClassifier on preprocessed features
- Extracted and ranked top features by importance for both targets

15. Compare Top Features
- Merged important features from h1n1_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine
- Visualized and compared their influence

## Visualizations Included
- Vaccination uptake by census_msa and hhs_geo_region
- Correlation heatmap of all features
- Feature importance bar plots
- Target variable distribution
